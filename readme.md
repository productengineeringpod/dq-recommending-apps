##Recommending apps which can be profitable on the play store and the app store

The goal of this notebook is to come up with suggestions on what apps to build which can be profitable on the play store and the app store.
Before begining the project, the assumption is that this recommnendation would be for only free apps - apps which do not need any money to be downloaded and where the primary source of revenue is via ads. Greater the number of users who see and engage with the ads, the better. Hence the notebook would help the users and developers understand what type of apps can attract more users.
